I want to learn about python a little more.

Here is a potential topic on climate:
https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3245/nasa-space-missions-pinpoint-sources-of-co2-emissions-on-earth/

Global warming is prevalent in our every day life and is constantly being researched. It takes alot of data science to come to conclusions about what is going on, how it is affecting us, and how we can stop it. This article has many links to maps that were put together using real data to show where co2 emmisions are coming from.

This is cool because they were able to plot the longitude and latitude of an emmision plume. It seems very doable in python if I had the data.

I am most intrested in thebfollowing topics as potential project ideas:
* global warming
* women in engineering
* robotics replacing jobs
